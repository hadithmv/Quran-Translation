Introduction

In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

Praise be to Allah who revealed the Quran as guidance for mankind and mercy for all creatures. Peace and blessings be upon our master and prophet Muhammad, the seal of the prophets and noble messengers, and upon his family and companions and those who follow them in goodness until the Day of Judgment.

Glory and praise be to Allah, the Almighty, the Sublime, the One True God. And we pray for blessings and peace upon His noble Messenger Muhammad, his family and companions, and all those who followed him righteously.

The Holy Quran is the true word of Allah revealed to Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. It is the supreme guidance sent down for all humanity, a sacred book bestowed as evidence distinguishing truth from falsehood. It is the greatest blessing Allah has given to believers. The book contains beliefs that believers must accept from the depths of their hearts, principles and rulings they must submit to, the straight path leading to happiness in both worlds, and lessons filled with wisdom. "لَّا يَأْتِيهِ الْبَاطِلُ مِن بَيْنِ يَدَيْهِ وَلَا مِنْ خَلْفِهِ ۖ تَنزِيلٌ مِّنْ حَكِيمٍ حَمِيدٍ" (فُصِّلَت ٤٢) Meaning: "No falsehood can approach it from before or behind it: It is a revelation sent down by the All-Wise, Worthy of all Praise." (Fussilat 42)

Given that the Maldives is, by the grace of Allah, a 100% Muslim nation, preparing, publishing, and making available a reliable translation of the Holy Quran in Dhivehi is something the government must provide for all Maldivians.

When I assumed the office of the President of the Maldives, the only Dhivehi translation of the Holy Quran available was the one completed during former President Ibrahim Nasir's term. I sincerely acknowledge this as valuable work done by him. However, it was a translation where different parts of the Holy Quran were translated separately by five different individuals. As a result, there are differences between various sections in terms of phrasing and conveyed meanings. Additionally, some scholars who emerged in the Maldives have translated certain parts of the Holy Quran into Dhivehi to varying degrees during different periods. These scholars have also provided Dhivehi translations of verses in their writings, lectures, and speeches. These efforts are certainly valuable. However, even these scholars have not gifted the Maldivian nation with a complete translation of the entire Holy Quran.

For these reasons, I recognized the great importance of having a reliable and authentic Dhivehi translation of the Holy Quran available to Maldivians. To fulfill this important responsibility, I formed a committee on April 25, 1979. The first meeting of this committee was held on May 1, 1979. I chaired this meeting myself. The discussion focused on establishing the main principles to follow in translating the meanings of the Holy Quran. We agreed to adhere to the principles used in translating the Quran into other languages. Following these principles, committee members primarily consulted Arabic Quranic tafsirs (exegeses) as their main reference when translating the Holy Quran into Dhivehi. However, the committee also sought assistance from English and Urdu translations of the Holy Quran in this endeavor.

Translating the Holy Quran into Dhivehi proved to be a very difficult and laborious task for the committee. The main reason was that since the Holy Quran was revealed in Arabic, and it contains Arabic eloquence and perfection at its highest level, it was extremely challenging to convey the beauty, perfection, eloquence, and metaphorical meanings of that noble word in a language like Dhivehi. Another reason was, as mentioned earlier, the scarcity of previous work done by Maldivian scholars in this field.

The Messenger of Allah ﷺ thoroughly conveyed and explained the Holy Quran to the Arabs. The next task was to convey and teach the Quran to those who don't know Arabic. This can be effectively accomplished by translating the meanings of the Holy Quran into the languages spoken by different peoples. In this regard, translations of the Holy Quran have been published in various languages spoken around the world for many hundreds of years. Even now, additional translations of the Quran continue to be published in different languages.

Therefore, the committee members, putting their trust in Allah, seeking His aid and guidance, fulfilled the important responsibility of translating the Holy Quran into Dhivehi with humility, trustworthiness, and sincerity.

The committee to which I entrusted this important and arduous task underwent various changes over time. With these changes, all the members who served on the committee were:

1. His Eminence the late Usthadh Sheikh Muhammad Jameel (M. Kulhhavaige)

2. His Eminence the late Usthadh Sheikh Moosa Fathuhee Qasim (M. Jeeza)

3. His Eminence Ustadh Sheikh Muhammad Rasheed Ibrahim (G. Gaskara)

4. His Eminence Ustadh Dr. Muhammad Zahir Hussain (H. Neelvilla)

5. His Eminence the late Sheikh Ahmed Shatir Moosa (H. Ehgamuge)

6. His Eminence Ustadh Sheikh Adam Naseem (H. Poonam)

7. His Eminence Ustadh Sheikh Hussain Abdurrahman (M. Dimyathu)

8. His Eminence Ustadh Sheikh Ahmed Farooq Muhammad (H. Hiyfahi)

9. His Eminence Ustadh Sheikh Ibrahim Zakariyya Moosa (M. Daashin)

These were the distinguished members.

The work begun by the committee on May 1, 1979, was completed on December 20, 1987. Following this, the government continuously worked to find a way to publish the Dhivehi translation of the Holy Quran to a high standard by consulting with various parties. However, due to different obstacles and challenges that arose at various times, it wasn't possible to bring this translation to light as quickly as desired. During this period, the committee members also continued the work of reviewing the translation.

At this opportunity, I would like to especially acknowledge two individuals from among these members. One is the late Fadhilathul Usthadhu Sheikh Moosa Fathuhee Qasim, who served as the chairman of this committee. I express my sincere gratitude to him for his arduous and sincere efforts. Similarly, Fadhilathul Usthadhu Sheikh Muhammad Rasheed Ibrahim practically carried out all matters related to this committee under his supervision. Since Fadhilathul Usthadhu Sheikh Muhammad Rasheed Ibrahim has continued to work on committee related tasks to this day, giving special importance to this matter, I remember this fact and express special thanks to him.

Since the beginning of the work of translating the Holy Quran into Dhivehi, I acknowledge the value of the generous assistance provided by Libya's World Islamic Call Society, and express sincere gratitude to the founder of that society, Colonel Muammar al-Gaddafi, the officials of the society, and the government of Libya.

For this translation of the Holy Quran, a special committee was selected to ensure consistency in the interpretation of similar verses. The committee included:

1. His Eminence Sheikh Muhammad Qubad Abu Bakr (Fiyaathoshige/Lh.Naifaru)

2. His Eminence Ustadh Adam Muhammad Abdullah (Fashuvimaage/L.Maavah)

3. His Eminence Ustadh Hassan Saeed (Reethigasdoshuge/S.Hithadhoo)

Later, to prepare the Dhivehi translation of the Holy Quran for printing, the layout work was assigned to a group of skilled individuals knowledgeable in such tasks. These individuals were:

1. His Eminence Ustadh Hassan Saeed (Reethigasdoshuge/S.Hithadhoo)

2. Mr. Ahmed Rasheed Abdul Qadir (M.Magumatheege)

3. His Eminence Ustadh Moosa Anwar Hassan (Rihivillaage/Gn.Fuvahmulah)

4. His Eminence Ustadh Abdullah Hameed (Nooranimaage/N.Henbadhoo)

5. His Eminence Ustadh Hamid Abu Bakr (Fiyathoshige/Lh.Naifaru)

After these individuals completed their work, in order to perfect the translation in terms of elegant Dhivehi language style, the task was entrusted to one of the finest literary scholars currently in the Maldives, Mr. Abdullah Sadiq of H.Aamuleege. He carried out this work with great care. For this, I extend my sincere gratitude to Mr. Abdullah Sadiq.

Mr. Abbas Ibrahim of M.Silvercloud, a highly accomplished Dhivehi language expert, also reviewed the translation from beginning to end. He contemplated how individual words and verses would be understood in Dhivehi, and made some changes to ensure the meanings of verses were properly conveyed in Dhivehi. Therefore, for his extensive work in this regard, I extend special thanks to Mr. Abbas Ibrahim.

After the layout of this new Dhivehi translation of the Holy Quran was completed and handed over, the heavy responsibility of printing was undertaken by Mr. Ali Hussain of M.Vareyvilla. He performed this task with dedication, great care, and excellence. Therefore, I deeply appreciate the value of his hard work and extend my heartfelt gratitude to Mr. Ali Hussain.

During the process of translating the Holy Quran into Dhivehi, I am pleased to express gratitude to those who assisted in various ways in their capacity as Executive Secretaries to the President: Mr. Abdullah Jameel of M.Dhoores, Mr. Abbas Ibrahim of M.Silvercloud, Mr. Abdulrasheed Hussain of MA.Uraha, and Mr. Mohamed Hussain of MA.Rihithari.

In addition, I extend special thanks to Mr. Abdullah Shahid of H.Rabee'ee Manzil, who not only helped in various ways as an Executive Secretary to the President but also prepared the layout for printing the Dhivehi translation of the Holy Quran and organized the printing work. I deeply appreciate his extensive efforts.

Furthermore, I express profound gratitude to Dr. Ahmed Shareef of M.Linkhouse for his work in his capacity as Executive Secretary during the final stage of printing the Dhivehi translation of the Holy Quran, helping to bring the project to completion.

I sincerely thank the late Mr. Mohamed Sadiq of M.Muringu, who served as the Presidential Advisor and provided assistance in various ways throughout the translation project of the Holy Quran into Dhivehi, from its inception until the final printing phase. I deeply appreciate his extensive efforts over a long period.

Additionally, I express my gratitude to the staff of the President's Office who assisted with the translation of the Holy Quran into Dhivehi for many months: Mr. Abdullah Waheed of B. Eydhafushi Thandiraiymaage, Mr. Mohamed Mufeed of GA. Maamendhoo Alifarudhaage, as well as the staff of the President's Office Typing Pool who worked at various times to type the Dhivehi translation on the computer, and Ms. Mariyam Rashida of H. Seagullge and Ms. Fathimath Rashida of Ma. Salveeniya who initially typed different parts of this translation.

Similarly, I extend my thanks to Mr. Ismail Abdul Qadir of G.Golhithereyge for resolving difficulties that arose when typing certain Arabic terms during the computerization of the Dhivehi translation, and to Mr. Mohamed Abdul Qadir of G.Golhithereyge for correcting the font used in this translation before the layout was created and enabling the layout to be written in that font.

I would also like to extend my gratitude to Mr. Ibrahim Ismail of Buruni and Mr. Ibrahim Fawzy of M.Orchidvadi, who served as Secretaries of the Committee for the Translation of the Holy Quran into Dhivehi, for their contributions.

May Allah reward all the previously mentioned individuals who contributed sincere efforts in various capacities and different aspects during this noble and demanding work that extended over many years! And for those among them who have departed from this world, I pray that Allah grants their souls eternal bliss in Paradise.

Before concluding my introduction, I wish to mention two very important points. The first is that, although by the grace of Allah we now have a Dhivehi translation of the Holy Quran at our disposal, it should be remembered that, only those who have achieved an adequate level of knowledge in Islamic jurisprudence, should use this translation to derive various religious rulings or use verses as evidence for different matters. This is because without proper understanding of the literal and metaphorical meanings of Quranic verses, general and specific rulings, absolute and conditional rulings, abrogating and abrogated texts, and similar concepts, it is impossible to fully comprehend the complete meaning, rulings, and objectives conveyed by the various verses of the Holy Quran.

The second point is that, regardless of how good the intentions were and how sincerely and carefully the work was done, every human endeavor will have shortcomings. Therefore, it is certain that this translation also contains imperfections. When such issues are identified, they should be corrected. Perfection is an attribute that belongs exclusively to Allah, the Glorified and Exalted.

For the generous guidance and assistance that Allah, the Glorified and Exalted, has given us in the heavy task of preparing a reliable Dhivehi translation of the Holy Quran, I offer praise and gratitude to Him, in the beginning and the end.

My prayer is that through this translation, Dhivehi brothers and sisters will understand the guidance, goodness, benefits, and rewards that the Holy Quran has brought to all humanity, and that Allah will grant them the wisdom and success to act upon it.

And the last of our supplication is that all praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
